This Discord Bot was idealized to let players roll dices in a simple way. There's no need to use sintax, just type your dice and voil√†!

## How to use:

Invite the bot to your server using this link: (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1236061103155445830&permissions=274877914112&scope=bot)

To roll the dices follow the pattern 1d20, where the first number declares the amount of dices will be rolled and the last number declares the value of the dices. The response will be something like the first image.
